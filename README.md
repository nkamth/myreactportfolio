## Instructions

- [Design](#design)

- [React](#react)

### Updated Portfolio

Your updated site should still have all of the content it previously had:

- Your name

- Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number

- A link to a PDF of your resume with updated projects

- A list of projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:

  - Project title

  - Link to the deployed version

  - Link to the GitHub repository

  - GIF or screenshot of the deployed application

#### Design

As with the previous portfolio homework, "good" design is subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

- Mobile-first design

- Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

- Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

- If you want to go above and beyond, try using animations and react component libraries. Note
  that this will _not_ affect your grade, but it may impact how potentials employers gauge your knowledge.

### React

Additionally, this new portfolio should be created using React.

At a minimum, your portfolio should include the following:

- A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages

- A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page

- Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router

- A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages

### Tech Used

Dependencies:

```bash
- "react": "^17.0.2",
- "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
- "react-scripts": "4.0.3",
```

## Usage

To use this repo, go to the cloned files, then type `npm start` in your command-line. Be sure youâ€™re in the correct location in your command-line/terminal first! Be sure you're also set up to run a react app!
